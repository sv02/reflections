When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  To collaborate with others and/or make changes across multiple work stations (home vs office). Also nice to have a cloud backup


 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 	the same reason anything else is manual  for commits and push-- to ensure it's necessary / intended. epecially if collabrating, don't want things updated automatically. You may not want the new updates at that time and don't want to overrride local changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	A clone is a copy of a repository. A branch is from within a repository -- e.g. side fix, experiment, may or may not merge back into the main master branch. Forking is just a github concept -- it's copying someone else's repository, giving them credit while you work on your own using their code as a base.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	when you need to merge, you can compare/check conflicts and make the corrections to what happened on the remote after you had pulled data from it.
